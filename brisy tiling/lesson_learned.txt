1. if the styles wont change from computed section, change it from the inline css with important tag.
2. if the effect wont apply, go to the end elemetn and apply. (for eg: a inside li tags are affected when a is
 specified and not li for most of the properties depending upon their defualt value. if the default is inherit,
  only then the properteis of the child will be affected when the property in parent is changed.)
3. everything would not come in mind before you begin. But after you begin, changes, mistakes adn focus will create ideas and help mind to rewind previous knowledge.  
4. to increase the size of carousel-background and to change the positoin of text infront of that background, target owl-item.
5. inline-height would not work when img-fluid is used in the class.
