1. You cant apply pseudo element with inline elements.
2. you cant change height and weight of inline elements.
3. z-index by default for every element is 0.
4. 1 rem = 16px;
5. break points: normally, breaking points are space and -. if breakwrod is 
set to break-word, the words will be broken at arbitrary points(word 
will go until the given width and the word will break after that given width), so it wont
overflow. 
and if set to normal, the word would break only after the breaking points and may overflow. 
6. if you have to calculate, you have to use calc() method. eg: font-size: calc(1rem+2px);
7. more detail learning in inspect.
8. word overflowing issues outside the column and container.
9. margin applied to the before and after content will overlap and would not create a 
space. for eg: there are two containers up and down. down container contain one div. i
 applied before:: to that div and applied margin-top:-10px. Now that before part will
  overlap the container on upside or if you have to apply make sure to give margin to 
  that div so the beofre or after part wont overlap others.
  So you should not apply margin to the pseudo elements.
10. When it comes to margins and padding, browsers treat inline elements differently. You
can add space to the left and right on an inline element, but you cannot add height
to the top or bottom padding or margin of an inline element.
11. to remove text-decoration of an anchor element, you have to apply to the css of 
an anchor element and not the element is inside.For example:
<div><a>learn more</a></div>.
Normally, learn more would have underline coz its a link.
Now you cant apply:
div{
    text-decoration: none;
}
But should do:
a{
    text-decoration: none;
}
11. breakpoints(space and hyphen)
12. experience. compfort . precious was in one line because ihad no space given after dot , so word wrap was (normal(by default)). 
13. z-index can be applied to inline element but make sure to specify position.

14. you cant appply positoin relative and then another element absoulte for video element maybe ont sure.

15. if the position is relative, if the element is applied 100px bottom,then 100px space is still occuied by the same element
down even if the element goes up. Solution is absolute. 

16. <div class="container my-0" >
                  <!-- by default there is 15px padding in container. -->

                  <div class="row g-5">
                  <!-- margin works in row -->
                  <!-- by default there is -15px margin in row-->
17. In CSS, margin properties can utilize negative values (padding cannot).
18. You should use important if you want to replace the styles of inbuild bootstrap classes because, bootstrap saas is inline.
19. absolute will go to the top:0 and left:0 of immediate previous positioned element.
20. z-index problem solved by putting negative index to the element to be on bottom. But
you have to give z-index higher than the bottom element for the top element in case if you are dealing with before and after.
However, with normal case, you can put the top elements z-index higher than the bottom one and the bottom one may have any z-index
and is not necessary to be 0.   
21. you can put float value while specifying left right etc.
22. img is inline but becomes block once we set height and width of it.
23. figure is inline element and has its default alignment and styling.
24. col and flex items are same because row is flex. Both of them get aligned to the ledt side like float.
25. it is a best practise to use main section name (lets say about us) before the actual element(lets say paragraph) while specifying in css.
26. it is best to maintain consistency in class name of parent and child.
eg:
<section class="worldwide">
      <div class="container worldwide-container"> //here (worldwide-container) makes it easy to understand if you have to apply effects in this element. Instead of specifying like (.worldwide .container)
27. space is not removed by html. 
eg:
try this:Down below, between i and b element, try putting space and removing.
<a href="#" class="btn"><i class="fa fa-reply-all" aria-hidden="true"></i> <b>get a quotes</b>
